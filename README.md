### REST Client in JavaScript

This is a simple REST client written in JavaScript that uses the `node-fetch` library to make HTTP requests to a REST API.
Also use `dotenv` to store the API_url in a .env file and load it.
`readline` used to get user input.

```bash
git clone url://github.com
cd rest-client-js
npm install
node main.mjs
```
